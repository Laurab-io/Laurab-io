### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Laurab-io/Laurab-io** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

- 💥 I’m currently a software engineer at [Hims](https://www.forhims.com/) & [Hers](https://www.forhers.com/)
- 🌱 I work in React, TypeScript, and Accessibility. 
- 🤩 Ask me about engineering
- 🎼 Fun fact: I play the violin, cello, mandolin, and fretless bass. Plus the guitar when bribed.
